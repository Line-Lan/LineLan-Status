# Line-Lan.net Statuspage

This is a simple status page that we use to monitor all of our services and to
give our users the ability to check if a error is server-side or client-side.

Configuration is stored in the file `config.inc.php` which is excluded by
`.gitignore`. Please refer to `config.sample.inc.php` for a configuration
example.
